This project is a travel agency website created as part of a term paper, designed to enable users to browse and book various travel tours with ease.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The React application is structured for optimal user experience, allowing customers to view available tours, explore detailed information, and make bookings seamlessly. The interface is designed to be responsive and interactive, providing users with smooth navigation and visual feedback on actions.
## Backend

The backend of the application is developed using the Echo framework in Go (Golang). Echo is known for its high performance, flexibility, and minimalistic design, making it well-suited for creating RESTful APIs. The backend handles user requests, manages business logic for booking operations, and securely interacts with the database to store and retrieve information on tours, bookings, and user data. This layer also includes validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and secure transactions.
## Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as its relational database. PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced querying and transactional integrity, which are essential for handling data related to tour details, user profiles, booking records, and any associated payments or confirmations. Database tables are structured to efficiently manage relationships between tours, users, and booking information, providing a reliable backend for data storage and retrieval.
